# Pre-activated-ResNet-prediction-model
Predicting neonatal scanning and gestational age at birth using pre-activated ResNet: Insights from the developing human connectome project

Project overview:

(1)Development of Resnet50 architecture with pre-activation, training optimised to below 0.9 error 

(2)Heatmap-based occlusion visualisation to determine which part of the (multi-channel 2D) image is most important for foetal age prediction.

(3)Weighted sampling to deal with class imbalance problems, and unmixing before the final linear layer of the network to achieve more complex birth age predictions and 
improve prediction accuracy.
